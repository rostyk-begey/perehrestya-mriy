    "description": "We are a team of like-minded patriots who, as ordinary volunteers and donors, have helped the army since the very beginning of the protracted war, when the aggressor began the occupation of Crimea and Donbas. It was then in 2014 that we realized that whatever support we can provide, it is extremely needed.\n\nAfter Russia mounted a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, our goal shifted to helping individual units of the Armed Forces to address their immediate needs. Each new day of the war underlined the urgency of expanding our activities, because even such elementary things as medical supplies for the population, are still needed today. \nAt one point, it became clear that we can not handle it on our own, and we need additional support , from both donors and volunteers. Thus, our team decided to establish \"Perehrestya Mriy\" Charity Fund. We believe it was a good and timely move that will enable us to yield great benefits not only for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but also our for native city of Kharkiv."
